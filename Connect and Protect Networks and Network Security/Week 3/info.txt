How intrusions compromise your system
In this section of the course, you learned that every network has inherent vulnerabilities and could become the target of a network attack.

Attackers could have varying motivations for attacking your organization’s network. They may have financial, personal, or political motivations, or they may be a disgruntled employee or an activist who disagrees with the company's values and wants to harm an organization’s operations. Malicious actors can target any network. Security analysts must be constantly alert to potential vulnerabilities in their organization’s network and take quick action to mitigate them.

In this reading, you’ll learn about network interception attacks and backdoor attacks, and the possible impacts these attacks could have on an organization.

Network interception attacks 
Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic and stealing valuable information or interfering with the transmission in some way.

Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit. This is referred to as packet sniffing. In addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious actors can also intercept network traffic and alter it. These attacks can cause damage to an organization’s network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the account receiving the funds to one that the attacker controls.

Later in this course you will learn more about malicious packet sniffing, and other types of network interception attacks: on-path attacks and replay attacks.

Backdoor attacks
A backdoor attack is another type of attack you will need to be aware of as a security analyst. An organization may have a lot of security measures in place, including cameras, biometric scans and access codes to keep employees from entering and exiting without being seen. However, an employee might work around the security measures by finding a backdoor to the building that is not as heavily monitored, allowing them to sneak out for the afternoon without being seen. 

In cybersecurity, backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks. However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after they’ve compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Once the hacker has entered an insecure network through a backdoor, they can cause extensive damage: installing malware, performing a denial of service (DoS) attack, stealing private information or changing other security settings that leaves the system vulnerable to other attacks. A DoS attack is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

Possible impacts on an organization
As you’ve learned already, network attacks can have a significant negative impact on an organization. Let’s examine some potential consequences.

Financial: When a system is taken offline with a DoS attack, or business operations are halted or slowed down by some other tactic, they prevent a company from performing the tasks that generate revenue. Depending on the size of an organization, interrupted operations can cost millions of dollars. In addition, if a malicious actor gets access to the personal information of the company’s clients or customers, the company may face heavy litigation and settlement costs if customers seek legal recourse.

Reputation: Attacks can also have a negative impact on the reputation of an organization. If it becomes public knowledge that a company has experienced a cyber attack, the public may become concerned about the security practices of the organization. They may stop trusting the company with their personal information and choose a competitor to fulfill their needs.

Public safety: If an attack occurs on a government network, this can potentially impact the safety and welfare of the citizens of a country. In recent years, defense agencies across the globe are investing heavily in combating cyber warfare tactics. If a malicious actor gained access to a power grid, a public water system, or even a military defense communication system, the public could face physical harm due to a network intrusion attack.




Read tcpdump logs
A network protocol analyzer, sometimes called a packet sniffer or a packet analyzer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. They are commonly used as investigative tools to monitor networks and identify suspicious activity. There are a wide variety of network protocol analyzers available, but some of the most common analyzers  include:

SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer

ManageEngine OpManager

Azure Network Watcher

Wireshark

tcpdump

This reading will focus exclusively on tcpdump, though you can apply what you learn here to many of the other network protocol analyzers you'll use as a cybersecurity analyst to defend against any network intrusions. In an upcoming activity, you’ll review a tcpdump data traffic log and identify a DoS attack to practice these skills. 

tcpdump 
tcpdump is a command-line network protocol analyzer. It is popular, lightweight–meaning it uses little memory and has a low CPU usage–and uses the open-source libpcap library. tcpdump is text based, meaning all commands in tcpdump are executed in the terminal. It can also be installed on other Unix-based operating systems, such as macOS®. It is preinstalled on many Linux distributions.

tcpdump provides a brief packet analysis and converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by humans. It prints information about each packet directly into your terminal. tcpdump also displays the source IP address, destination IP addresses, and the port numbers being used in the communications. 

Interpreting output
tcpdump prints the output of the command as the sniffed packets in the command line, and optionally to a log file, after a command is executed. The output of a packet capture contains many pieces of important information about the network traffic. 

types of information presented in a tcpdump packet capture.
Some information you receive from a packet capture includes: 

Timestamp: The output begins with the timestamp, formatted as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second.  

Source IP: The packet’s origin is provided by its source IP address.

Source port: This port number is where the packet originated.

Destination IP: The destination IP address is where the packet is being transmitted to.

Destination port: This port number is where the packet is being transmitted to.

Note: By default, tcpdump will attempt to resolve host addresses to hostnames. It'll also replace port numbers with commonly associated services that use these ports.

Common uses
tcpdump and other network protocol analyzers are commonly used to capture and view network communications and to collect statistics about the network, such as troubleshooting network performance issues. They can also be used to:

Establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and network utilization metrics.

Detect and identify malicious traffic

Create customized alerts to send the right notifications when network issues or security threats arise.

Locate unauthorized instant messaging (IM), traffic, or wireless access points.

However, attackers can also use network protocol analyzers maliciously to gain information about a specific network. For example, attackers can capture data packets that contain sensitive information, such as account usernames and passwords. As a cybersecurity analyst, It’s important to understand the purpose and uses of network protocol analyzers. 




Real-life DDoS attack
Previously, you were introduced to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. You also learned that volumetric distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks overwhelm a network by sending unwanted data packets in such large quantities that the servers become unable to service normal users. This can be detrimental to an organization. When systems fail, organizations cannot meet their customers' needs. They often lose money, and in some cases, incur other losses. An organization’s reputation may also suffer if news of a successful DDoS attack reaches consumers, who then question the security of the organization.

In this reading you’ll learn about a 2016 DDoS attack against DNS servers that caused major outages at multiple organizations that have millions of daily users. 

A DDoS targeting a widely used DNS server 
In previous videos, you learned about the function of a DNS server. As a review, DNS servers translate website domain names into the IP address of the system that contains the information for the website. For instance, if a user were to type in a website URL, a DNS server would translate that into a numeric IP address that directs network traffic to the location of the website’s server. 

On the day of the DDoS attack we are studying, many large companies were using a DNS service provider. The service provider was hosting the DNS system for these companies. This meant that when internet users typed in the URL of the website they wanted to access, their devices would be directed to the right place. On October 21, 2016, the service provider was the victim of a DDoS attack.

Leading up to the attack
Before the attack on the service provider, a group of university students created a botnet. A botnet is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder." Each computer in the botnet can be remotely controlled to send a data packet to a target system. In a botnet attack, cyber criminals instruct all the bots on the botnet to send data packets to the target system at the same time, resulting in a DDoS attack.

The group of university students posted the code for the botnet online so that it would be accessible to thousands of internet users and authorities wouldn’t be able to trace the botnet back to the students. In doing so, they made it possible for other malicious actors to learn the code to the botnet and control it remotely. This included the cyber criminals who attacked the DNS service provider.

The day of attack
At 7:00 a.m. on the day of the attack, the botnet sent tens of millions of DNS requests to the service provider. This overwhelmed the system and the DNS service shut down. This meant that all of the websites that used the service provider could not be reached. When users tried to access various websites that used the service provider, they were not directed to the website they typed in their browser. Outages for each web service occurred all over North America and Europe. 

The service provider’s systems were restored after only two hours of downtime. Although the cyber criminals sent subsequent waves of botnet attacks, the DNS company was prepared and able to mitigate the impact. 





Overview of interception tactics
In the previous course items, you learned how packet sniffing and IP spoofing are used in network attacks. Because these attacks intercept data packets as they travel across the network, they are called interception attacks.

This reading will introduce you to some specific attacks that use packet sniffing and IP spoofing. You will learn how hackers use these tactics and how security analysts can counter the threat of interception attacks.

A closer review of packet sniffing 
As you learned in a previous video, packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network. On a private network, data packets are directed to the matching destination device on the network. 


The device’s Network Interface Card (NIC) is a piece of hardware that connects the device to a network. The NIC reads the data transmission, and if it contains the device’s MAC address, it accepts the packet and sends it to the device to process the information based on the protocol. This occurs in all standard network operations. However, a NIC can be set to promiscuous mode, which means that it accepts all traffic on the network, even the packets that aren’t addressed to the NIC’s device. You’ll learn more about NIC’s later in the program. Malicious actors might use software like Wireshark to capture the data on a private network and store it for later use. They can then use the personal information to their own advantage. Alternatively, they might use the IP and MAC addresses of authorized users of the private network to perform IP spoofing.

A closer review of IP spoofing 
After a malicious actor has sniffed packets on the network, they can impersonate the IP and MAC addresses of authorized devices to perform an IP spoofing attack. Firewalls can prevent IP spoofing attacks by configuring it to refuse unauthorized IP packets and suspicious traffic. Next, you’ll examine a few common IP spoofing attacks that are important to be familiar with as a security analyst.

On-path attack
An on-path attack happens when a hacker intercepts the communication between two devices or servers that have a trusted relationship. The transmission between these two trusted network devices could contain valuable information like usernames and passwords that the malicious actor can collect. An on-path attack is sometimes referred to as a meddler-in-the middle attack because the hacker is hiding in the middle of communications between two trusted parties.

Or, it could be that the intercepted transmission contains a DNS system look-up. You’ll recall from an earlier video that a DNS server translates website domain names into IP addresses. If a malicious actor intercepts a transmission containing a DNS lookup, they could spoof the DNS response from the server and redirect a domain name to a different IP address, perhaps one that contains malicious code or other threats. The most important way to protect against an on-path attack is to encrypt your data in transit, e.g. using TLS. 

Smurf attack
A smurf attack is a network attack that is performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user’s IP address and floods it with packets. Once the spoofed packet reaches the broadcast address, it is sent to all of the devices and servers on the network. 

In a smurf attack, IP spoofing is combined with another denial of service (DoS) technique to flood the network with unwanted traffic. For example, the spoofed packet could include an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping. As you learned earlier, ICMP is used to troubleshoot a network. But if too many ICMP messages are transmitted, the ICMP echo responses overwhelm the servers on the network and they shut down. This creates a denial of service and can bring an organization’s operations to a halt.

An important way to protect against a smurf attack is to use an advanced firewall that can monitor any unusual traffic on the network. Most next generation firewalls (NGFW) include features that detect network anomalies to ensure that oversized broadcasts are detected before they have a chance to bring down the network.

DoS attack
As you’ve learned, once the malicious actor has sniffed the network traffic, they can impersonate an authorized user. A Denial of Service attack is a class of attacks where the attacker prevents the compromised system from performing legitimate activity or responding to legitimate traffic. Unlike IP spoofing, however, the attacker will not receive a response from the targeted host. Everything about the data packet is authorized including the IP address in the header of the packet. In IP spoofing attacks, the malicious actor uses IP packets containing fake IP addresses. The attackers keep sending IP packets containing fake IP addresses until the network server crashes.

Pro Tip: Remember the principle of defense-in-depth. There isn’t one perfect strategy for stopping each kind of attack. You can layer your defense by using multiple strategies. In this case, using industry standard encryption will strengthen your security and help you defend from DoS attacks on more than one level.
