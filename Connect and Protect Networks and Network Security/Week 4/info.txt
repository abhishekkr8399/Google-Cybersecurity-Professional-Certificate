Brute force attacks and OS hardening
In this reading, you’ll learn about brute force attacks. You’ll consider how vulnerabilities can be assessed using virtual machines and sandboxes, and learn ways to prevent brute force attacks using a combination of authentication measures. Implementing various OS hardening tasks can help prevent brute force attacks. An attacker can use a brute force attack to gain access and compromise a network.

Usernames and passwords are among the most common and important security controls in place today. They are used and enforced on everything that stores or accesses sensitive or private information, like personal phones, computers, and restricted applications within an organization. However, a major issue with relying on login credentials as a critical line of defense is that they’re vulnerable to being stolen and guessed by malicious actors. 

Brute force attacks
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.

Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks. 

Assessing vulnerabilities
Before a brute force attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, companies can run a series of tests on their network or web applications to assess vulnerabilities. Analysts can use virtual machines and sandboxes to test suspicious files, check for vulnerabilities before an event occurs, or to simulate a cybersecurity incident.

Virtual machines (VMs)
Virtual machines (VMs) are software versions of physical computers. VMs provide an additional layer of security for an organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the rest of the computer or system. VMs can also be deleted and replaced by a pristine image after testing malware. 

VMs are useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment. Using a VM may prevent damage to your system in the event its tools are used improperly. VMs also give you the ability to revert to a previous state. However, there are still some risks involved with VMs. There’s still a small risk that a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine. 

You can test and explore applications easily with VMs, and it’s easy to switch between different VMs from your computer. This can also help in streamlining many security tasks.

Sandbox environments
A sandbox is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network. They are commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Sandboxes can also be used to evaluate suspicious software, evaluate files containing malicious code, and simulate attack scenarios. 

Sandboxes can be stand-alone physical computers that are not connected to a network; however, it is often more time- and cost-effective to use software or cloud-based virtual machines as sandbox environments. Note that some malware authors know how to write code to detect if the malware is executed in a VM or sandbox environment. Attackers can program their malware to behave as harmless software when run inside these types of  testing environments. 

Prevention measures
Some common measures organizations use to prevent brute force attacks and similar attacks from occurring include: 

Salting and hashing: Hashing converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. It is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text. Salting adds random characters to hashed passwords. This increases the length and complexity of hash values, making them more secure.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor authentication (2FA): MFA is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. This verification happens using a combination of authentication factors: a username and password, fingerprints, facial recognition, or a one-time password (OTP) sent to a phone number or email. 2FA is similar to MFA, except it uses only two forms of verification.

CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA: CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. It asks users to complete a simple test that proves they are human. This helps prevent software from trying to brute force a password. reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service from Google that helps protect websites from bots and malicious software.

Password policies: Organizations use password policies to standardize good password practices throughout the business. Policies can include guidelines on how complex a password should be, how often users need to update passwords, and if there are limits to how many times a user can attempt to log in before their account is suspended.





Network security applications
This section of the course covers the topic of network hardening and monitoring. Each device, tool, or security strategy put in place by security analysts further protects—or hardens—the network until the network owner is satisfied with the level of security. This approach of adding layers of security to a network is referred to as defense in depth.

In this reading, you are going to learn about the role of four devices used to secure a network—firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and security incident and event management tools. Network security professionals have the choice to use any or all of these devices and tools depending on the level of security that they hope to achieve. 

This reading will discuss the benefits of layered security. Each tool mentioned is an additional layer of defense that can incrementally harden a network, starting with the minimum level of security (provided by just a firewall), to the highest level of security (provided by combining a firewall, an intrusion detection and prevention device, and security event monitoring).

Take note of where each tool is located on the network. Each tool has its own place in the network’s architecture. Security analysts are required to understand the network topologies shown in the diagrams throughout this reading.

Firewall
So far in this course, you learned about stateless firewalls, stateful firewalls, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), and the security advantages of each of them.

Most firewalls are similar in their basic functions. Firewalls allow or block traffic based on a set of rules. As data packets enter a network, the packet header is inspected and allowed or denied based on its port number. NGFWs are also able to inspect packet payloads. Each system should have its own firewall, regardless of the network firewall.

A firewall circled by dashes, protecting the internal network from internet traffic that comes in through the mode.
Intrusion Detection System 
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. An IDS alerts administrators based on the signature of malicious traffic.

The IDS is configured to detect known attacks. IDS systems often sniff data packets as they move across the network and analyze them for the characteristics of known attacks. Some IDS systems review not only for signatures of known attacks, but also for anomalies that could be the sign of malicious activity. When the IDS discovers an anomaly, it sends an alert to the network administrator who can then investigate further.

The limitations to IDS systems are that they can only scan for known attacks or obvious anomalies. New and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. The other limitation is that the IDS doesn’t actually stop the incoming traffic if it detects something awry. It’s up to the network administrator to catch the malicious activity before it does anything damaging to the network. 

An IDS circled above an image of a switch, which rests between a firewall and the network.
When combined with a firewall, an IDS adds another layer of defense. The IDS is placed behind the firewall and before entering the LAN, which allows the IDS to analyze data streams after network traffic that is disallowed by the firewall has been filtered out. This is done to reduce noise in IDS alerts, also referred to as false positives.

Intrusion Prevention System 
An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an application that monitors system activity for intrusive activity and takes action to stop the activity. It offers even more protection than an IDS because it actively stops anomalies when they are detected, unlike the IDS that simply reports the anomaly to a network administrator.

An IPS searches for signatures of known attacks and data anomalies. An IPS reports the anomaly to security analysts and blocks a specific sender or drops network packets that seem suspect. 

An IPS is situated between a firewall and the internal network.
The IPS (like an IDS) sits behind the firewall in the network architecture. This offers a high level of security because risky data streams are disrupted before they even reach sensitive parts of the network. However, one potential limitation is that it is inline: If it breaks, the connection between the private network and the internet breaks. Another limitation of IPS is the possibility of false positives, which can result in legitimate traffic getting dropped.

Full packet capture devices
Full packet capture devices can be incredibly useful for network administrators and security professionals. These devices allow you to record and analyze all of the data that is transmitted over your network. They also aid in investigating alerts created by an IDS. 

Security Information and Event Management 
A security information and event management system (SIEM) is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools work in real time to report suspicious activity in a centralized dashboard. SIEM tools additionally analyze network log data sourced from IDSs, IPSs, firewalls, VPNs, proxies, and DNS logs. SIEM tools are a way to aggregate security event data so that it all appears in one place for security analysts to analyze. This is referred to as a single pane of glass. 

Below, you can review an example of a dashboard from Google Cloud’s SIEM tool, Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data.

Image of the Chronicle dashboard
Splunk is another common SIEM tool. Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Both options include detailed dashboards which help security professionals to review and analyze an organization's data. There are also other similar SIEM tools available, and it's important for security professionals to research the different tools to determine which one is most beneficial to the organization.

A SIEM tool doesn’t replace the expertise of security analysts, or of the network- and system-hardening activities covered in this course, but they’re used in combination with other security methods. Security analysts often work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) where they can monitor the activity across the network. They can then use their expertise and experience to determine how to respond to the information on the dashboard and decide when the events meet the criteria to be escalated to oversight.

Secure the cloud
Earlier in this course, you were introduced to 
cloud computing
. Cloud computing is a model for allowing convenient and on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. These resources can be configured and released with minimal management effort or interaction with the service provider. 

Just like any other IT infrastructure, a cloud infrastructure needs to be secured. This reading will address some main security considerations that are unique to the cloud and introduce you to the shared responsibility model used for security in the cloud. Many organizations that use cloud resources and infrastructure express concerns about the privacy of their data and resources. This concern is addressed through cryptography and other additional security measures, which will be discussed later in this course.

Cloud security considerations
Many organizations choose to use cloud services because of the ease of deployment, speed of deployment, cost savings, and scalability of these options. Cloud computing presents unique security challenges that cybersecurity analysts need to be aware of. 

Identity access management
Identity access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can use different cloud resources. A common problem that organizations face when using the cloud is the loose configuration of cloud user roles. An improperly configured user role increases risk by allowing unauthorized users to have access to critical cloud operations. 

Configuration
The number of available cloud services adds complexity to the network. Each service must be carefully configured to meet security and compliance requirements. This presents a particular challenge when organizations perform an initial migration into the cloud. When this change occurs on their network, they must ensure that every process moved into the cloud has been configured correctly. If network administrators and architects are not meticulous in correctly configuring the organization’s cloud services, they could leave the network open to compromise. Misconfigured cloud services are a common source of cloud security issues. 

Attack surface 
Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer numerous applications and services for organizations at a low cost. 

Every service or application on a network carries its own set of risks and vulnerabilities and increases an organization’s overall attack surface. An increased attack surface must be compensated for with increased security measures.

Cloud networks that utilize many services introduce lots of entry points into an organization’s network. However, if the network is designed correctly, utilizing several services does not introduce more entry points into an organization’s network design. These entry points can be used to introduce malware onto the network and pose other security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that CSPs often defer to more secure options, and have undergone more scrutiny than a traditional on-premises network. 

Zero-day attacks
Zero-day attacks are an important security consideration for organizations using cloud or traditional on-premise network solutions. A zero day attack is an exploit that was previously unknown. CSPs are more likely to know about a zero day attack occurring before a traditional IT organization does. CSPs have ways of patching hypervisors and migrating workloads to other virtual machines. These methods ensure the customers are not impacted by the attack. There are also several tools available for patching at the operating system level that organizations can use.

Visibility and tracking 
Network administrators have access to every data packet crossing the network with both on-premise and cloud networks. They can sniff and inspect data packets to learn about network performance or to check for possible threats and attacks.

This kind of visibility is also offered in the cloud through flow logs and tools, such as packet mirroring. CSPs take responsibility for security in the cloud, but they do not allow the organizations that use their infrastructure to monitor traffic on the CSP’s servers. Many CSPs offer strong security measures to protect their infrastructure. Still, this situation might be a concern for organizations that are accustomed to having full access to their network and operations. CSPs pay for third-party audits to verify how secure a cloud network is and identify potential vulnerabilities. The audits can help organizations identify whether any vulnerabilities originate from on-premise infrastructure and if there are any compliance lapses from their CSP. 

Things change fast in the cloud
CSPs are large organizations that work hard to stay up-to-date with technology advancements. For organizations that are used to being in control of any adjustments made to their network, this can be a potential challenge to keep up with. Cloud service updates can affect security considerations for the organizations using them. For example, connection configurations might need to be changed based on the CSP’s updates. 

Organizations that use CSPs usually have to update their IT processes. It is possible for organizations to continue following established best practices for changes, configurations, and other security considerations. However, an organization might have to adopt a different approach in a way that aligns with changes made by the CSP. 

Cloud networking offers various options that might appear attractive to a small company—options that they could never afford to build on their own premises. However, it is important to consider that each service adds complexity to the security profile of the organization, and they will need security personnel to monitor all of the cloud services. 

Shared responsibility model
A commonly accepted cloud security principle is the shared responsibility model. The shared responsibility model states that the CSP must take responsibility for security involving the cloud infrastructure, including physical data centers, hypervisors, and host operating systems. The company using the cloud service is responsible for the assets and processes that they store or operate in the cloud.

The shared responsibility model ensures that both the CSP and the users agree about where their responsibility for security begins and ends. A problem occurs when organizations assume that the CSP is taking care of security that they have not taken responsibility for. One example of this is cloud applications and configurations. The CSP takes responsibility for securing the cloud, but it is the organization’s responsibility to ensure that services are configured properly according to the security requirements of their organization. 



Cryptography and cloud security
Earlier in this course, you were introduced to the concepts of the shared responsibility model and identity and access management (IAM). Similar to on-premise networks, cloud networks also need to be secured through a mixture of security hardening practices and cryptography. 

This reading will address common cloud security hardening practices, what to consider when implementing cloud security measures, and the fundamentals of cryptography. Since cloud infrastructure is becoming increasingly common, it’s important to understand how cloud networks operate and how to secure them.

Cloud security hardening
There are various techniques and tools that can be used to secure cloud network infrastructure and resources. Some common cloud security hardening techniques include incorporating IAM, hypervisors, baselining, cryptography, and cryptographic erasure.

Identity access management (IAM)
Identity access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can leverage different cloud resources.

Hypervisors
A hypervisor abstracts the host’s hardware from the operating software environment. There are two types of hypervisors. Type one hypervisors run on the hardware of the host computer. An example of a type one hypervisor is VMware®'s EXSi. Type two hypervisors operate on the software of the host computer. An example of a type two hypervisor is VirtualBox. Cloud service providers (CSPs) commonly use type one hypervisors. CSPs are responsible for managing the hypervisor and other virtualization components. The CSP ensures that cloud resources and cloud environments are available, and it  provides regular patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in hypervisors or misconfigurations can lead to virtual machine escapes (VM escapes). A VM escape is an exploit where a malicious actor gains access to the primary hypervisor, potentially the host computer and other VMs. As a CSP customer, you will rarely deal with hypervisors directly.

Baselining
Baselining for cloud networks and operations cover how the cloud environment is configured and set up. A baseline is a fixed reference point. This reference point can be used to compare changes made to a cloud environment. Proper configuration and setup can greatly improve the security and performance of a cloud environment. Examples of establishing a baseline in a cloud environment include: restricting access to the admin portal of the cloud environment, enabling password management, enabling file encryption, and enabling threat detection services for SQL databases.

Cryptography in the cloud
Cryptography can be applied to secure data that is processed and stored in a cloud environment. Cryptography uses encryption and secure key management systems to provide data integrity and confidentiality. Cryptographic encryption is one of the key ways to secure sensitive data and information in the cloud.

Encryption is the process of scrambling information into ciphertext, which is not readable to anyone without the encryption key. Encryption primarily originated from manually encoding messages and information using an algorithm to convert any given letter or number to a new value. Modern encryption relies on the secrecy of a key, rather than the secrecy of an algorithm. Cryptography is an important tool that helps secure cloud networks and data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. You’ll learn more about cryptography in-depth in an upcoming course.

Cryptographic erasure
Cryptographic erasure is a method of erasing the encryption key for the encrypted data. When destroying data in the cloud, more traditional methods of data destruction are not as effective. Crypto-shredding is a newer technique where the cryptographic keys used for decrypting the data are destroyed. This makes the data undecipherable and prevents anyone from decrypting the data. When crypto-shredding, all copies of the key need to be destroyed so no one has any opportunity to access the data in the future.

Key Management
Modern encryption relies on keeping the encryption keys secure. Below are the measures you can take to further protect your data when using cloud applications:

Trusted platform module (TPM). TPM is a computer chip that can securely store passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.

Cloud hardware security module (CloudHSM). CloudHSM is a computing device that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys and processes cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption.

Organizations and customers do not have access to the cloud service provider (CSP) directly, but they can request audits and security reports by contacting the CSP. Customers typically do not have access to the specific encryption keys that CSPs use to encrypt the customers’ data. However, almost all CSPs allow customers to provide their own encryption keys, depending on the service the customer is accessing. In turn, the customer is responsible for their encryption keys and ensuring the keys remain confidential. The CSP is limited in how they can help the customer if the customer’s keys are compromised or destroyed. One key benefit of the shared responsibility model is that the customer is not entirely responsible for maintenance of the cryptographic infrastructure. Organizations can assess and monitor the risk involved with allowing the CSP to manage the infrastructure by reviewing a CSPs audit and security controls. For federal contractors, FEDRAMP provides a list of verified CSPs.
